3D Protein Structure Visualization Dashboard â€“ Interactive Bioinformatics Tool
Developed a web-based dashboard to visualize 3D protein structures using PyMOL and ESMFold API data. Designed an intuitive interface to input protein sequences and dynamically fetch and render predicted 3D models. Integrated molecular visualization capabilities to support rotation, zoom, and analysis of protein conformations. Enabled researchers and students to explore protein structures efficiently for educational and exploratory research purposes.
